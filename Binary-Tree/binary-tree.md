1. [ **Full Binary Tree** ]
A Binary Tree is a full binary tree if every node has 0 or 2 children. 

Total numebr of nodes = $2^{n} - 1$
, n - number of layer

### On the basis of the completion of levels:

1. [ **Complete Binary Tree** ]:
 A Binary Tree is a Complete Binary Tree if all the levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible.
