# Leetcode practice log

This is to track my progress in practicing Leetcode coding problems. It also serves as a documentation of my thoughts when cracking the problems.

This space saves coding problem encountered from any coding assessment for learning purpose only.

## Common clarifications:

- How big is the size of the input?
- How big is the range of values?
- What kind of values are there? Are there negative numbers? Floating points? Will there be empty inputs? Is it string? 
- Are there duplicates within the input?
- What are some extreme cases of the input?
- How is the input stored? If you are given a dictionary of words, is it a list of strings or a trie?

## Steps:

1. Read the problem. Think about edge cases. Ask for clarifications
1. How you plan to solve it at a high level
1. Focus on solving! \
    Keep the conversation going, solicit feedback:
    - I have a feeling I could get the performance better here, I’d like to get this working first and circle back to it at the end with time permitting
    - For some reason I have a suspicion there might be edge cases that could bite us at this point, but I can’t put my finger on one…do you have any thoughts?
    - I had hoped that I could keep this in a single loop for performance, but at this point am not seeing a way around adding a second. If I have time at the end, I would definitely come back and tighten up some things, just as I would with real code before submitting a PR
1. Keep the code clean, use built-in function. 
1. Analyse time and space complexity before the interivewer asks you 
1. Test your code (dry run)
